Hello everyone, ive been looking for a free script like this for a while but haven't been able to find any until I found Jackis20's Weapon from Car/Dufflebag script, but that script was getting older and didn't have some key features that I thought were really important so I decided to remaster the code. 

What is different?
New sling feature. (When you take the gun out of the trunk you can do /sling to sling it on your back) do /unsling to unsling it. This allows you to carry it without having to get it again from your trunk. There were also a few other small bugs in that script that I fixed. 

Just drag and drop into recourses and make sure to start the recourse in the server.cfg. Updates coming soon for any buys please report them on the CFX release page
